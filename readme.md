- Maven
- EhCache
- H2 database
- Log4j
- Spring Data
- Swagger 2
- Lombok
- Intellij IDEA
    
  
##Installation and running the application


###With usage of Intellij IDEA

- Import project from repository
- Use Maven to build project: ```install -f pom.xml```
- Run project with: ```spring-boot:run -f pom.xml```


###Usage with Command Line

Attention: JAVA_HOME as system variable required

- Open command line in project's main directory
- Use Maven to build project: ```./mvnw install```
- Use commends: 
``` 
cd target

java -jar weather-0.0.1.jar
```

  
##Usage of project with Swagger UI

1. Open link http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

Correct authorization with JWT token is required.

More info about JTW: https://jwt.io/introduction

First step is to use POST method login in LoginController with predefined user data in request body:
``` 
{
  "login": "test",
  "password": "test"
} 
```

In the response we get:
``` 
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ0ZXN0IiwiZXhwIjoxNjE0OTc2ODEwfQ.CARSk0S8NW5CIW_KkCHA4S_j1gLyldKVAXshoCb918E"
}
```

To be able to use all methods now we need to paste the value in quotation marks (Bearer XYZ) for key "Authorization" from that response body to Swagger's authorizations pop'up (green button "Authorize" with lock icon).

If the authorization is successful, we can verify that fact by using the method http://localhost:8080/login/test.

In response, we should see response body with a word 'test';
